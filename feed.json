Organizations adopting this approach prioritize the development and innovation of products based on their own beliefs about market needs. Their focus lies in building a superior product and then convincing customers to buy it. Research and development (R&amp;D) and technological advancements take center stage as they strive to create a unique selling proposition.</p>\n<p>One of the advantages of a product-driven approach is the ability to introduce groundbreaking products and set new industry standards. By focusing on their internal expertise, companies can leverage their core competencies to deliver innovative solutions. However, this approach carries risks, such as developing products that may not align with customer demands or overlooking evolving market trends.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples: </strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\">       <img  src=\"https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//apple-emblem.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"179\" height=\"147\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" srcset=\"https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/apple-emblem-xs.jpg 300w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/apple-emblem-sm.jpg 480w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/apple-emblem-md.jpg 768w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/apple-emblem-xl.jpg 1200w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/apple-emblem-xxl.jpg 1600w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/apple-emblem-xxxl.jpg 2560w\"></figure>                                              <figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//Tesla_logo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"168\" height=\"168\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" srcset=\"https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/Tesla_logo-xs.png 300w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/Tesla_logo-sm.png 480w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/Tesla_logo-md.png 768w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/Tesla_logo-xl.png 1200w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/Tesla_logo-xxl.png 1600w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/Tesla_logo-xxxl.png 2560w\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\">     <img  src=\"https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//631_dyson_logo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"214\" height=\"161\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" srcset=\"https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/631_dyson_logo-xs.jpg 300w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/631_dyson_logo-sm.jpg 480w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/631_dyson_logo-md.jpg 768w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/631_dyson_logo-xl.jpg 1200w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/631_dyson_logo-xxl.jpg 1600w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/631_dyson_logo-xxxl.jpg 2560w\"></figure>                                       <figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//Sony-Logo-Font.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"206\" height=\"149\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" srcset=\"https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/Sony-Logo-Font.jpg-xs.webp 300w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/Sony-Logo-Font.jpg-sm.webp 480w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/Sony-Logo-Font.jpg-md.webp 768w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/Sony-Logo-Font.jpg-xl.webp 1200w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/Sony-Logo-Font.jpg-xxl.webp 1600w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/Sony-Logo-Font.jpg-xxxl.webp 2560w\"></figure>\n<h5>Customer-Driven approach: </h5>\n<p>In contrast, the customer-driven approach places the customer at the heart of decision-making processes. This strategy involves actively seeking and analyzing customer feedback, preferences, and market trends to develop products and services that effectively meet customer needs. By understanding their target audience, companies can tailor their offerings, provide personalized experiences, and establish long-term relationships.</p>\n<p>Adopting a customer-driven mindset offers several advantages. Firstly, it enables businesses to identify and address specific pain points, resulting in higher customer satisfaction and loyalty. Secondly, it helps companies stay attuned to market shifts, ensuring they adapt and evolve alongside changing customer preferences. Finally, a customer-driven approach fosters a deeper understanding of customer behavior, facilitating effective marketing strategies and enhancing overall competitiveness.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\"><strong>Examples</strong></span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\">    <img  src=\"https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//amazon-logo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"236\" height=\"115\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" srcset=\"https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/amazon-logo-xs.png 300w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/amazon-logo-sm.png 480w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/amazon-logo-md.png 768w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/amazon-logo-xl.png 1200w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/amazon-logo-xxl.png 1600w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/amazon-logo-xxxl.png 2560w\"></figure>                 <figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//airbnb.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"298\" height=\"111\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" srcset=\"https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/airbnb-xs.png 300w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/airbnb-sm.png 480w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/airbnb-md.png 768w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/airbnb-xl.png 1200w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/airbnb-xxl.png 1600w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/airbnb-xxxl.png 2560w\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\">    <img  src=\"https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//netflix-logo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"238\" height=\"135\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" srcset=\"https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/netflix-logo-xs.png 300w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/netflix-logo-sm.png 480w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/netflix-logo-md.png 768w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/netflix-logo-xl.png 1200w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/netflix-logo-xxl.png 1600w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/netflix-logo-xxxl.png 2560w\"></figure>                 <figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//Salesforce.com_logo.svg.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"244\" height=\"171\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" srcset=\"https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/Salesforce.com_logo.svg-xs.png 300w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/Salesforce.com_logo.svg-sm.png 480w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/Salesforce.com_logo.svg-md.png 768w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/Salesforce.com_logo.svg-xl.png 1200w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/Salesforce.com_logo.svg-xxl.png 1600w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13//responsive/Salesforce.com_logo.svg-xxxl.png 2560w\"></figure>\n<h5>Finding the Balance</h5>\n<p>While the merits of both approaches are evident, striking the right balance is crucial. Overemphasizing a product-driven approach risks developing products that fail to meet customer expectations(many startups fail due to this), resulting in missed opportunities and declining sales. On the other hand, an extreme customer-driven approach may lead to constant customization requests that strain resources and erode profitability.</p>\n<p>To find the ideal balance, businesses can adopt an iterative approach that combines customer insights with internal expertise. Market research and customer feedback should drive product development, ensuring that the final offering aligns with market needs. Simultaneously, organizations should leverage their core competencies and innovative capabilities to create products that surpass customer expectations.</p>\n<h5><strong>Product managers (for product driven and customer driven products):</strong></h5>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 49.9288%;\"><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\"><strong>Customer Driven</strong></span></td>\n<td style=\"width: 49.9288%;\"><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\"><strong>Product Driven</strong></span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 49.9288%;\">Understand customer needs, pain points, and desires</td>\n<td style=\"width: 49.9288%;\">Rely on internal assumptions, stakeholders, biases </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 49.9288%;\">Prioritizes customer feedback </td>\n<td style=\"width: 49.9288%;\">Prioritize technical considerations &amp; internal objectives.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 49.9288%;\">Iterative product development</td>\n<td style=\"width: 49.9288%;\">Linear development process, sticking to predetermined product plans and specifications</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 49.9288%;\">Customer success metrics</td>\n<td style=\"width: 49.9288%;\">Budget, timelines, goals</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 49.9288%;\">Collaborate with cross functional teams</td>\n<td style=\"width: 49.9288%;\">Focus on building own team  </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>",

PCI-DSS offers certification in different levels called Level 1,2,3 etc - where Level 1 is most stringent.   </pre>\n<h3>Abstraction </h3>\n<p>Different types of merchants use these PSPs, gateways, methods and channels in different combinations. For instance,  </p>\n<p>Hyperlocal merchants: They know exactly what methods are most popular in their country or city. They do direct integrations with some channels like Internet Banking and e-Wallets, thereby avoid payment gateway charges. Many merchants also don't want the engineering &amp; regulatory complexity of payments and choose to go with gateways/PSPs for all payment methods and channels.  </p>\n<p>SaaS merchants: SaaS companies focus more on product, marketing and sometimes sell globally. Most SaaS merchants go for payment gateway who can support local payment methods, currency conversions, PCI-DSS compliance, subscription payments, invoicing etc </p>\n<p>Cross country merchants(Airlines etc):  Transaction volumes are pretty high with airlines and airlines generally offer local payment methods by partnering with local gateways or PSPs</p>\n<h3>Problem &amp; Opportunity</h3>\n<p>Formal problem statement: Merchants rely on <strong>ONE</strong> PSP or gateway and spend internal engineering time/money/effort to maintain payments. In turn gateways charge merchants hefty price (generally x% per transaction). </p>\n<p>Real problem statement: Payment transaction costs are day light robbery. Payment transaction costs go to payment gateway, issuing bank, acquiring bank. On top of this currency conversions, subscription payment charges, invoicing prices, fraud protection tools etc. If a merchant's margin is $15 for $100 transaction, there's a chance she might be paying $7.5 just to payment gateway.</p>\n<p>Opportunity: Merchants have a real opportunity to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Integrate payment methods directly and increase bottom line. They can avoid paying payment gateways altogether. </li>\n<li>Offer more local payment methods and increase top line.</li>\n<li>For card payments, switch gateways based on pricing. Example: High number of transaction days(Sale, Christmas, Black Friday etc) </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Challenge for merchants to do this by themselves is effort in engineering, time spent and they might loose focus on the actual product/service. </p>\n<h3>Enter Payment Orchestration Providers </h3>\n<p>But what is need for \"orchestration\"? </p>\n<p>Like I mentioned, merchants often rely on one payment provider and this provider dictate transaction costs and it takes a lot of time and effort for merchants to move to a different gateway. </p>\n<p>Payment orchestration platforms have chance here to: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Integrate multiple payment gateways so merchants can pit payment gateways against each other for better pricing</li>\n<li>Enable revenue teams to control payment flows without writing code</li>\n<li>Route payment flows based on type of transaction (method, currency, amount, fraud detection etc)  </li>\n<li>Offer direct integrations</li>\n<li>Offer standardised checkout page </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Just imagine to control something like this using UI within browser rather than writing hundreds of lines of code:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/12/PoP.001-2-xl-3.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" srcset=\"https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/12/responsive/PoP.001-2-xl-3-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/12/responsive/PoP.001-2-xl-3-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/12/responsive/PoP.001-2-xl-3-md.jpeg 768w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/12/responsive/PoP.001-2-xl-3-xl.jpeg 1200w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/12/responsive/PoP.001-2-xl-3-xxl.jpeg 1600w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/12/responsive/PoP.001-2-xl-3-xxxl.jpeg 2560w\"></figure></figure>\n<h3>Some Players</h3>\n<p>Many startups have been experimenting, trying to match market-product fit etc. Some of them are: </p>\n<p>1. <a href=\"https://primer.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Primer</a>: Recently raised $50 million dollars in Series B.

            "content_html": "<p><strong>Question</strong>: Why are some bloggers so successful? </p>\n<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Quality content. They care about content, quality of writing, images, videos etc. They don't care about perfect design or a static website solution. </p>\n<p>Having said that, if you're looking for a simple and free way to host a static website, here are some ways (with some code &amp; no-code) ways.</p>\n<p>But before going there, lets establish some principles: </p>\n<h3>Principles:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Ease</strong>: make and edit content easily without writing tons of code</li>\n<li><strong>Performance</strong>: Gone are the days when you have to maintain a server, configure it for high performance. End of the day, a blog is nothing but text &amp; media with few plugins for comments, forms, analytics etc. So a \"serverless\" or a \"headless\" CMS might be a preferred way in 2022. </li>\n<li><strong>Cost</strong>: Well, ideally we want it to be completely free of cost. But may be you might need to shell out a few bucks. </li>\n<li><strong>Maintenance</strong>: If you're anything like me, you hate maintenance. Patching, tuning, configuration, these are some of the most boring things you want to do and we'd like to focus on content more. </li>\n<li><strong>Security</strong>: Static sites don’t have any entry points for a malicious party to exploit. The underlying managed service is ultimately responsible for securing the infrastructure. Having said that we want to choose https so the browsers don't tell your user your website is insecure. </li>\n<li><strong>Portability</strong>:  Most static sites provide the ultimate cloud-agnostic, portable solution. But changing CMS itself might not be a great experience. </li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight\">Pro Tip: Checkout <a href=\"https://www.expireddomains.net/\">https://www.expireddomains.net</a> for picking deleted or expired domains. </p>\n<h3>1.

Is it because we're product first and not market first? </p>\n<h2>Looking at product vs market first: </h2>\n<p>When you're making an MVP, you're essentially making effort to validate your assumption that your product is going to be worthy to the user or solve a problem. And When you imagine a product first, you first think of: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Features</li>\n<li>UX</li>\n<li>UI, Design, Typography</li>\n<li>Programming langues, cloud providers </li>\n<li>CI/CD </li>\n</ol>\n<p>.....and the list goes on. </p>\n<p>We don't know if any of these adds any value to the user . Remember: an MVP is neither a technology nor a cheaper product, its about smart learning</p>\n<p>But when you start looking at market first, you think of: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>User</li>\n<li>User segmentation </li>\n<li>Personas</li>\n<li>User pain points</li>\n<li>Current user journey &amp; friction points</li>\n<li>Value add (time, effort or money saving) </li>\n<li>How is the user currently solving the problem you're addressing?</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Value hypothesis &amp; Growth Hypothesis</h2>\n<p>Too often, founders, product managers, stake holders start with conclusions, not assumptions. The former is a set of beliefs, while the latter are fundamental questions to be answered. On the surface, that sounds like a nuanced difference, but in practice, it is a huge change in mindset and action. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/9/value-and-growth-xxxl.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"645\" height=\"451\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" srcset=\"https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/9/responsive/value-and-growth-xxxl-xs.png 300w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/9/responsive/value-and-growth-xxxl-sm.png 480w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/9/responsive/value-and-growth-xxxl-md.png 768w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/9/responsive/value-and-growth-xxxl-xl.png 1200w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/9/responsive/value-and-growth-xxxl-xxl.png 1600w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/9/responsive/value-and-growth-xxxl-xxxl.png 2560w\"></figure></figure>\n<p>The <strong>value hypothesis</strong> tests whether your product or service provides customers with enough value and most importantly, whether they are prepared to pay for this value.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>Lets say you're developing a payment analytics product</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This product helps e-commerce firms to aggregate payment sources(payment gateways + PSPs + Paypal etc)</li>\n<li>Provides actionable KPIs to increase top and bottom lines</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking first about:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>SDKs &amp; APIs</li>\n<li>Dashboard</li>\n<li>Metrics &amp; Features</li>\n<li>Notifications etc </li>\n</ol>\n<p>But lets look at market first: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Segment e-commerce market by firmographics (Location, size of the firm, revenue, performance) </li>\n<li>Target users within the firm (may be payments team or a revenue team reporting to a CRO) </li>\n<li>What are their needs related to payment analytics? Do they feel they have enough insights about payments? (Example: authorisation/decline rates by each payment method and channel) </li>\n<li>What more actionable insights can they use to increase their top line and bottom line? </li>\n</ol>\n<p>With these questions you consider making an MVP with least effort and handful of features and test with your target users whether it adds value and if they are willing to pay for such a product. </p>\n<p>The <strong>growth hypothesis</strong> tests how your customers will find your product or service and shows how your potential product could grow over the years.</p>\n<p>You assume next 5 customers who signup to your payment analytics products are because of your first client. After you speak to your next customers you may find out it can be due to a particular process, metric, or pricing strategy. Its not necessarily bad you're proven wrong, but it helps to record this growth hypothesis and use it for next 5-8 customers. </p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Looking at market first can make big difference at all stages of the product for continued success with your MVP, growth, pivot and more.  </p>",

The term 'Lean' has its origins in manufacturing of Toyota production system where the goal was to continuously add value while eliminating waste. Project managers with agile thinking make better connection with terms like 'Muda' (waste), 'Muri' (Overburden) and 'Mura'(Unevenness). As product managers, lean thinking and understanding Muda is required to set goals, ruthlessly prioritise and continuously add value to your users. Ultimately, to ensure you're spending least time, effort &amp; money to deliver what matters the most.  </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/7/blog.001.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" srcset=\"https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/7/responsive/blog.001-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/7/responsive/blog.001-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/7/responsive/blog.001-md.jpeg 768w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/7/responsive/blog.001-xl.jpeg 1200w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/7/responsive/blog.001-xxl.jpeg 1600w ,https://spsrinivas.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/7/responsive/blog.001-xxxl.jpeg 2560w\"></figure>\n<p>First, lets look at different types of Muda: </p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Muda Type 1:</span> Doesn't add value, but essential for users. </p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Muda Type 2:</span> Doesn't add value and non-essential for users. </p>\n<h3>Muda Type 1: </h3>\n<p>Let's say you are a PM, designing a car for emerging markets. You start listing down benefits (or value proposition) : </p>\n<ol class=\"ordered-list\">\n<li>Mileage of at least 20km per litre of petrol and 25km per litre of diesel</li>\n<li>Safety features for all 5 seats </li>\n<li>In-built navigation support </li>\n<li>Intelligent Surround sound system  </li>\n<li>Save time in parking </li>\n<li>Maximising space</li>\n<li>3 sec acceleration to 100km/h </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Using lean process, one way of prioritising benefits is by differentiating benefits into 3 bigger buckets: Cost of entry, value proposition and delight factors  </p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"align-center\" style=\"width: 50%;\">Cost of Entry </td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">Mileage </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\"> </td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">Maximising space </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\"> </td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">Safety features </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"align-center\" style=\"width: 50%;\">Value proposition </td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">Navigation support</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\"> </td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">Surround system</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"align-center\" style=\"width: 50%;\">Delight</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">Parking time </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>\"Cost of Entry\" is Muda Type 1 - a necessary evil, meaning - most of your competitors are already providing these features. Unless you provide the \"cost of entry\" benefits to your target users, it might not be called a car. Think of it more like a cover charge for a pub you are going to for New years' party. </p>\n<p>Benefits which DOES NOT add value but essential to your users. </p>\n<h3>Muda Type 2:</h3>\n<p>Let's look at benefit 6 &amp; 7.</p>\n<p>- 3 sec acceleration to 100km/h to the target market - emerging markets. Do users really care about precision acceleration in emerging markets ? </p>\n<p>- If Parking time benefit is mapped to self-parking feature, would driver really care about it or argue against the practicality of this feature?</p>\n<p>These are classic example of Muda type 2, doesn't add value and non-essential for users.</p>\n<h3>Product Managers' time &amp; Muda </h3>\n<p>Time management can make or break a product manager in her job. A product manager is never \"done\", and end-up spending time, effort, money to deliver. If you are a PM, you must have heard the line \"Strategy means saying no\". In Steve Jobs words: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"quoteText\">People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.</p>\n<p>- Steve Jobs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So what can we do to apply lean thinking and \"eliminate muda\" in our jobs  ? </p>\n<h6>1. Time management</h6>\n<p>- Razor sharp focus in meetings (Remember: Agile tells you \"individuals and interactions over processes and tools\"), balancing interactions and time in meetings. </p>\n<p>- Pomodoro technique - 25min for a single task, break for 5min - repeat </p>\n<p>- Strategy planning and roadmapping to ensure minimal waste in answering the what and why questions </p>\n<h6>2. Effort </h6>\n<p>- It's best to do one thing really well. Prioritise benefits and features ruthlessly, use value vs effort matrix in lean process to prioritise </p>\n<p>- SMART Goals setting. Use established frameworks like OGSM and OKRs to set goals</p>\n<p>- Engineering effort, documentation:</p>\n<p>Do you really need certain tools, documentation and resources ? Ask yourself from wastage standpoint: </p>\n<ol class=\"ordered-list\">\n<li>Do you really want to spend time, money and effort in managing a Hive or would BigQuery/Redshift do the job? </li>\n<li>Do you really need comprehensive documentation in describing functional and non-functional requirements or would \"INVEST\" user story with appropriate acceptance criteria save everyones time ? </li>\n<li>Do you really need to do sprint retrospectives every sprint or once in two sprints is good enough ? </li>\n</ol>\n<h3>In conclusion: </h3>\n<p>Simply put Muda is waste, however it's background is much deeper. Take a moment to understand what it really means and you will be wiser for it - it can be time, effort, money, environment, sustainability etc. It's easier to save a minute but impossible to make one.  </p>\n<p> </p>",
